Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
We used Express HTML instead of traditional HTML for the customer facing web page. This allowed us to dynamically render the page with trips that we fetched from the MongoDB database. We used Handlebars as a template to help in creating the HTML. We used Angular to implement the SPA since it can dynamically render content and does not require a reload or refresh in the browser. We used Node.js for the javascript and used it on both the front and back end.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it is easy to modify the schema since it is non-relational. Honestly I think that a relational SQL database would have worked just as well since we had very specific requirements for the database and it seems that columns would have worked just as good. I guess it boils down to if we wanted to change something later, it might be a little easier with a non-relational database.

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON is a format used to represent data structures, and it is language-independent, meaning it can be utilized with different programming languages. While JSON's syntax is derived from JavaScript, it is not exclusive to JavaScript. It is commonly used in APIs to facilitate the exchange of information between the frontend and backend of applications, and JavaScript is one of the languages that can easily work with JSON data.

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
